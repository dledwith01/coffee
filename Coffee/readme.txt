This application, 'coffee', prevents your PC from going to sleep by simulating presses of the keyboard (specifically the 'shift' key)
Presses are simulated every 5 to 300 seconds (5 minutes) at a random interval each time
This lightweight application launches in the background and can be controlled via the system tray

Instructions:
Right-click from the system tray to view a pop-up menu to control the application
	open - opens a window
		the window displays logging information with a time stamp of the most recent simulated press of the keyboard
		buttons are available to control the application
		minimize button will minimize application to the task bar
		exit button will close the window but keep the application running in the system tray
	start - starts simulating keyboard presses (application starts on launch)
	stop - stops simulating keyboard presses
	exit - exits the application
